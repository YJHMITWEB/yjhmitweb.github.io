Hi, I am currently in my second year of Ph.D. studies at The Ohio State University, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7FXtL98AAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Dhabaleswar K. (DK) Panda</a>, focusing the research on developing advanced high-performance computing (HPC) and networking strategies specifically for artificial intelligence (AI) models and applications. My work is particularly geared towards large-scale parallel inference on AI models, with a special focus on foundation models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision. This includes the design of efficient GPU kernels and the optimization of communication strategies for distributed inference systems. 

Before joining OSU, I was a research assistant at Fudan University, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-wOTCE8AAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Li Zhang</a> at <a href='https://fudan-zvg.github.io/index.html'>Zhang Vision Group</a> . My research focus was on designing efficient Transformers for computer vision and NLP tasks.

<!-- During my bachelor, I worked with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XTEwtAAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Jun Yu</a> at Media Intelligence Lab at Hangzhou Dianzi University, where I studied 2D object detection and Visual Question Answering. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
